How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    the variables side by side made it easy to pick up .

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    find my mistakes and how i think and how i should think

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros: upload at milestones where you know you completed something
    
    cons: upload randomly, bandwidth issues, pc might crash and loose you work

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    because programs might have different interacting parameters and functions 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log
    git diff old_version_commit new_version_commit
  

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    git checkout version_commit_you_want_to_check
      detached HEAD
      
    i would make changes knowing that if it doesn't work I can get 
    new version up

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    All the things!!!
    
.bash_profile

source ~/git-completion.bash  #tab completion

git clone .git_address

git config --global core.editor "tw -n -w"
git config --global push.default upstream
git config --global merg.conflictsyle diff3
